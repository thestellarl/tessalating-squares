# Tessalating Squares
My take on an assignment that uses a Haskell based language to output simple 2D graphics.
Disclaimer: the name may be misleading because the shapes don't represent a true tessalating pattern

**Note:** Render.hs and Minilogo.hs contain portions from the course instructor Eric Walkingshaw. 
"Great class" ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

## Made possible with
- ✨Magic ✨ and  SVG's stroke-dasharray and stroke-dashoffset to properties to produce an animated effect in the output
